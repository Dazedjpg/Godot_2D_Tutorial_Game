# **My First Godot 2D Game**

This is the first 2D game I've made using Godot.  
I'm still learning, so this is just an experimental project 😅

---

**What's in this project:**  
- A simple 2D game  
- Still following the tutorials from Godot Docs  
- Just for learning and experimenting

**How to play:**  
1. Install **Godot 4**  
2. Open this project folder in Godot  
3. Run the main scene (usually `Main.tscn`)
