# **My First Godot 2D Game**

This is the first 2D game I've made using Godot.  
I'm still learning, so this is just an experimental project 😅

**What's in this project:**  
- A simple 2D game  
- Still following the tutorials from Godot Docs  
- Just for learning and experimenting

**How to play:**   
1. Run the `.exe` file
2. Press enter or click the start button to start the game, and you can control the character using **Arrow Keys**.
